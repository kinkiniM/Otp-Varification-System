# Otp-Varification-System


## Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing an OTP (One-Time Password) verification system in Python. The system should generate a 6-digit OTP and send it to the user's email address for verification. Upon receiving the OTP, the user should enter it into the system for validation. If the entered OTP matches the generated OTP, access should be granted; otherwise, access should be denied.

## Project Requirements
- Implement a function to generate a 6-digit OTP randomly.
- Develop a function to simulate sending the OTP to the user's email address.
- Create a function to prompt the user to enter the OTP received in their email.
- Implement a function to verify if the entered OTP matches the generated OTP.
- Ensure proper error handling and user-friendly prompts throughout the system.
- Allow the user to retry OTP entry in case of incorrect input.

## Project Deliverables
- A Python script containing the implementation of the OTP verification system.
- Documentation explaining the functionality of each function, how to run the program, and any dependencies required.
- Test cases to ensure the system functions correctly under various scenarios, including correct and incorrect OTP entries.
- Optionally, a simple GUI interface for the OTP verification system to enhance user experience.

## Installation and Usage
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `smtplib`, `random`, `time`, `getpass` (if applicable)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/otp-verification-system.git
   cd otp-verification-system
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Program
Run the Python script using:
```bash
python otp_verification.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter and verify the OTP.

## Project Evaluation Criteria
Your project will be evaluated based on the following aspects:
- Correctness and functionality of the OTP generation, sending, and verification process.
- Code quality, including adherence to Python best practices, readability, and documentation.
- Error handling and user interaction aspects of the system.
- Robustness and reliability of the system under different scenarios.
- **Optional:** Creativity and usability of the GUI interface (if implemented).

## Security Considerations
- Handle sensitive information (such as email addresses and OTPs) securely and responsibly.
- Avoid hardcoding any sensitive data or credentials in your code.
- Consider using environment variables or a secure vault for storing credentials.
